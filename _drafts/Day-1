# Day 1

This week's task is to work with landing pages.

A first question: **what projects need landing pages** for? IOW I don't need just one single page for my business. I will probably need to create several pages for major product launches or new initiatives, or even ideas or teasers (to see if they get any traction).
So, 

- [] make a list of projects or initiatives that could use landing pages
- [] add some key info to share on the page (see resources for making *good* landing pages, e.g. Shapiro

Next, for any given landing page you need **basic resources**: colors, font(s), and image assets.

- [] decide on and gather up branding and image assets; use color palette helpers, unsplash, illustrations or icons, brand assets (etc)

You'll need **ideas for design**. Check dribble, land-book site, and/or template options (per your website builder). Or prepare to DIY.

- [] get an idea for the overall design of your landing page

Choose your **website builder** (and template if you are using one). So far, I have worked with Carrd, Dorik, and Webflow. These are all fine options (at increasingly levels of featurs/power and complexity), so:

- [] choose website builder & template, if desired (Carrd, Dorik, Webflow -- or other)

Special components needed? If your template doesn't have some special components you might need (e.g. pricing table), consider getting them from elfsight.com or some other resource. (Note: see CTA, forms, etc next.)

- [] plan for any special embeds you might need

At this point, you can create a static page. IF you want/need a CTA, there are a variety of options. Basically, think about where you want people to enter your buyer's journey:

- [] decide if you want people (basically) to 

- a) follow you on social; 
- b) sign up for your email list (for example with Mailchimp or ConvertKit); 
- c) sign up for your newsletter; 
- d) contact you (via a form); 
- e) become a (free) member (i.e. do a genuine sign-up) right away.

These are probably the main options for a CTA. 

Note that you may need to provide a lead magnet to swap for an email address. (I won't address LMs here. It will take more than a simple landing page to offer one.)
Without attaching some kind of payment system, a member sign-up will need to be free.
The "power up" for this week's assignment is to include membership or community, so that applies especially to option e.

Once you *decide* what kind of CTA you're going for, then it will be possible to figure out what tool options there are to accomplish it. See [Notes on CTAs](#)
