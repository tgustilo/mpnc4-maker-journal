# Day 1

This week's project is to work on landing pages.

Worked on today

✅ added folders and drafts here on my build journal (put drafts in "_drafts" folder; folders will require an extra url step: my-site/posts/post1.html)
✅ added projects and notes folders, as well as posts; and added a couple files (see index)
✅ learned some more about how to use Github interface for editing (tricky! -- to create a folder, do it when you name it using "/"; to move a file back up out of a folder, use "../")
✅ learned that if you create a release/tag (snapshot), you have to go back to main or you can't edit

Next steps

- fix the formatting on tasks (displays fine in Github preview, but browser adds bullet in front of checkbox. For now, will just use an emoji or bullet instead)
- choose which landing page you'll work on (see [Ideas](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/projects/landing-page-ideas.html)
