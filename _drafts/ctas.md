# Thinking throught CTAs

There are five basic options for a landing page (or other marketing) CTAs (Call to Action). You want your site visitor to do something, to respond in some way. You want them to enter a "buyer's journey."

The following options go from very light responses to more intensive and committed.

## You want visitors to follow you on social media

Strategy: get some nice social media icons and link to your social accounts. This assumes you have social accounts set up and active and are updating them regularly. (You need a social media marketing strategy and to understand how SM content will help your future customers, clients, supporters, etc.)

## You want visitors to sign up for your email list

Much business wisdom emphasizes that you need to start right away to develop your email list and/or "followers" (see social media above). A landing page then would have its primary CTA as a way to capture email addresses.

Strategy: the traditional way is to use an email service provider (ESP) like MailChimp or ConvertKit (or one of a g'zillion others). You have a couple of options:

1. drop in a capture form provided by your ESP service (right onto your web page)
2. design a special form using your web builder and use Zapier or an integration to move that data into your ESP (or elsewhere)
3. use a 3rd party form service (e.g. Typeform, Tally, Formspree), embed this on your website, and then use an integration or Zapier to move that data into your ESP (or elsewhere)

Note that you may need to provide a **lead magnet** to swap for an email address. (It will likely take more than a simple landing page to offer one, so I won't elaborate here. Simply search "lead magnet" to find out more.)

Email lists are the traditional means of marketing. You also have the option to explore "all-in-one" or marketing CRMs (customer relationship management). These are fuller databases that have some email capability, but also allow tracking more details of contacts through a sales process. Use a CRM (along with, or instead of an ESP) if your buyer's journey is longer or more complicated or requires direct and personal interaction from you or your sales team. (ESP *automations* try to provide an intermediate way to move your potential customers along without you having to interact with each one personally.)

Outseta and Airtable are two friendly no-code ways to manage a simple CRM. Outseta provides a drop-in form (see also membership sign-up below), while Airtable will require a Zap to move data from your website over. You can then configure Airtable however you like to work with your customer (potential customer) data.

## You want visitors to sign up for your newsletter

What do you do when you have a list of emails? You send them emails. These could be marketing emails (of various sorts), or you could subscribe them to your newsletter.

In this case, you could still use an ESP, or you could go direct to a newsletter service such as Substack, Ghost, or Revue (which is now owned by and directly connected up with TWitter). Most ESPs also now offer newsletter services.

The newsletter service will provide an embeddable sign-up form to drop on your website, or you may use a service like this to power your website in the first place, e.g. Ghost. (Or you can use your web builder's form and use an integration or Zap to send the data over to your newsletter service.)

## You want visitors to contact you / fill out a form

This could be an application for membership, or "tell us what you're interested in," or to request a quote.

Strategy: use either your web builder's form module, or a 3rd party form service to capture information. Usually contact forms will email you directly with the content, so you can respond accordingly. Or, you can work with the data as captured within your website platform OR use an integration or Zap to transfer the data to your CRM or elsewhere.

## You want visitors to become a (free) member, i.e. do a genuine sign-up on your site, right away.

If you want to allow visitors to sign up for an account or membership right away (for free, unless you intend to integrate a payment system), you can either use your website builder's module (e.g. Ghost) or use a 3rd party membership plug-in / service such as Outseta, Memberspace, Memberstack. These services allow you also to put some content on your website (goes beyond a landing page) behind a paywall, or simply "gate" it, so that members have to log in to be able to see it.

The "power up" for this week's assignment is to include membership or community, which applies especially to this option.
