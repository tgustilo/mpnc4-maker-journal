# Connected Content Project

See Twitter thread:
So it all started when I wanted to make my own course player... (to avoid paying $$! ::Grimacing face:: for a course platform geared more to providing elaborate business functions than best-in-class tools for creating and delivering highest quality educ content and learning experience)
For my #mpnc4 project(s) I'm thinking of working on Connected Content: a way to create, deliver, and consume a series of blog posts, a sequence of lessons, an itinerary of travel bookings (!::Exploding head::), steps along a coaching journey...
Even better... a way to coordinate and *mix & match* between these, for educational travel, travel blogging, travel coaching...
What's needed by a content creator and a content consumer working through Connected Content, especially if one allows for versioning and iteration?
A content creator plans / brainstorms a bunch of content "pieces," and some possible sequences and connections between them
(A "piece" is a post or lesson, a media link or embed, e.g. a YT video, a downloadable document, a destination, activity, booking... anything really)
The content creator goes through the process of creating a first version of key content pieces selected from the original brainstorm (whatever is deemed highest value, to start)
Content creator sequences (inter-connects) those content pieces for a first published version -- with choice of metaphor, delivery platform (ideally cross-platform, content re-purposing)
Content consumer receives and "plays" through the sequence (series of blog posts, lessons in a course, steps in a coaching journey, potential bookings for a trip itinerary, or a creative combination of those)
And there is tracking (for the sake of both consumer and creator); and iteration to a next improved version, which when re-published is (re-)consumable by the original or future consumers
There oughta be a flexible drop-in tool that could help this process along... yes? Connected Content ::Hammer and wrench:: ::Link symbol:: ::Clinking glasses::

The things you can connect:
- series of blog posts
- course lessons
- steps in coaching
- travel itinerary (destinations, bookings, daily activities)

Types of connections: sequential, but could be bidirectional or multi-directional (e.g. Obsidian, PKBs)

Workflow steps (as in twitter thread):
- content creator brainstorms and plans (and prioritizes)
- create content
- sequence content for delivery
- user (content consumer, reader, student) "plays" (e.g. a course player)
- there is tracking (for the user to track his progress; for the creator to analyze and improve)

Features
- content is repurpose-able (atomic); can be used in multiple sequences
- sequences themselves can run parallel and cross-link / mix & match, e.g. a travel itinerary could parallel a series of course lessons and have "horizontal" interlinks (for a trip-specific course)
- there is iteration

Types of Content "pieces" (atomic)
- markdown (or full posts, including embeds, images, etc)
- links (cooperate with bookmarking and read-it-later services); also for newsletters & curation; also to downloadable files (e.g. pdfs, ebooks, etc)
- data (table-like for structured rows/records and fields)
Note: multimedia content can be captured via link or markdown
