# Landing Page Ideas

1. Re-do my main business home page (again). Not an enticing project.
2. Create a page for my World History for Travelers course idea.
3. Create a page for How to Create a Sustainable Travel Itinerary (part course, part coaching, maybe webinar event, maybe lead magnet).
4. Create a personal or professional page (have the domain sitting there unused).
5. Create a special home for my personal blog (currently hosted Blot; use PP domain).

(This could go on for a while... Need to just pick ONE!)
