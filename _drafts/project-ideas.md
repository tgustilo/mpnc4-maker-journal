Writing300 - this is for 300 people to record their daily wins to establish a writing habit (could be wordcount, don't break the chain -- except a day off allowed and can record sick days, and vacations, if desired), number of days per week, number of minutes per session: give options for success); use special FM group - payment scheme is to pay at the end when you've succeeded in establishing 300 days (i.e. 50 weeks per year, 6 days per week). Once you've finished, you pay $50 (or whatever you want) if you've completed your goal. You pay extra for each day you didn't complete on a sliding/increasing scale, for example 5c each for first 5 under 300, then 10c each for next 5, etc.Payment goes into effect after 30 days of success (input credit card; does it charge right away? $10 downpayment maybe, with rest due on account at end?) Riffs on Fighting 300 (Spartans, holding the pass).

Books & Places - along with Sustainable Dev Itinerary and WH for Travelers, this is a major initiative; it's close to destination specific courses (books are matched to destinations), but focuses on books rather than whole learning experiences; could also be a book club, or just bibliographies collected. Do need to work on geotagging of books problem!

Take your Brand with You - or TOBY - CSS Suitcase - figures out which CSS (including image and icon assets) is most essential to your brand and figures out a way to create your brand(s), package it up, and drop it into any website without disrupting the rest of the css or theme. Can work on WP, webflow, other site builders, as well as markdown editor previews and exports (e.g. Ulysses, iAWriter, and so on). Relates (maybe) to classess css libraries which focus on specifying html tags only, which is what you need for markdown anyway. Could also specify certain components to drop in (cf elfsight?) but focus on branding them. E.g. logo, banner, top nav bars, footers, etc.
