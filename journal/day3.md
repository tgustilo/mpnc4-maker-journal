# Day 3

Today is actually the start of Makerpad No Code Fundamentals Course **Week 2**. A few things I did on other days last week are incorporated here, but I was sick so wasn't able to accomplish stuff.

## Done

- [x] worked through a couple git videos on cloning to/and push from local, so I understand better (will attempt local asap on this repo!)
- [x] agonized over my Connected Content project, decided it needs two versions: (1) a local, md-based, internal tool; and (2) eventually a cloud-based or cross-platform app using a db. I decided I will not use this project for my main Makerpad project(s), but I personally need the local, personal tool, so will work on it on the side using Obsidian, git, SSG, and some theming. The cloud-based "public" version will wait.
- [x] instead I will work on a resource directory / reviews site for sustainable travel, for TAs and travelers (membership-based), and start with directories for countries, suppliers, organizations, and TAs. The directory will offer basic information as to sustainable travel efforts for each (TA directory will allow links out to their business sites); and implement reviews/comments so members can keep adding information and experience.
- [x] started this week's training on Disco re: Airtable / Softr (still need to do the automation)

Note: the Sustainable Travel Directory project may ultimately move or share data with my travel agency host per recent discussion; there are also other databases that can be added (e.g. city/region, specific hotels/resorts, etc) plus additional things to do as a sustainable travel membership, for both TAs and travelers (e.g. Q & A and trainings/events).

## Next Steps

- set up prototype Airtable bases for four directories and reviews/comments
- add data from C's document
- sign up for Softr and start playing with the tool; compare with new Airtable Interface!?
- Decide last week's assigments: use Softr landing page and membership sign-up; OR, re-do my business page (take it off Webflow host / export; move to Netlify), and(?) re-think my biz membership for power-up (go free and direct to Heartbeat?)
- review all git repos (including move *this* to local) and Netlify hosted; and check all domains (clean up stuff)
- continue with this week's Makerpad coursework & events
- update projects & notes pages here in my build journal to reflect changes
