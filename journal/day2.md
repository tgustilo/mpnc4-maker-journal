# Day 2

Playing catch-up a little from yesterday.

Completed

- [x] Set up online editing of markdown files for this build journal (get an error on preview, but figured out how to commit -- click the little branch thing at left and commit at the top of the left panel)
- [x] Added a list of running tasks
- [x] Created drafts of several long posts to go in projects and notes, including more details on Connected Content and CTAs
- [x] Went back to my earlier attempts in both Dorik and Webflow, and still evaluating which tool to focus on for this project

A key feature I need: not so much for landing page (marketing), but for substantive content dev projects, I want to be able to *export html, css, and js* for hosting a website elsewhere, e.g. via a static site generator such as Github Pages / Jekyll, or another SSG (or just for use generally in theming, or previewing markdown and pushing it to styled web content, i.e. html with css). Whatever website builder platform I invest time in, I want it to do double duty for both landing pages and for design work.

Some next steps

- [ ] Really have to pick one landing page for the cohort assignment, and use one site builder!
- [ ] Work especially on chosen CTA option and implementation (for marketing content -- vs. substantive content) See [Thinking through CTAs](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/notes/ctas.html)
