# Day 2

Playing catch-up a little from yesterday.

Completed

- [x] Set up online editing of markdown files for this build journal (get an error on preview, but figured out how to commit -- click the little branch thing at left and commit at the top of the left panel)
- [x] Added a list of running tasks
- [x] Created drafts of several long posts to go in projects and notes, including more details on Connected Content and CTAs
- [x] Went back to my biz site attempts in both Dorik and Webflow and still evaluating where to focus for web design (a key feature: want to be able to export html, css, and js for hosting a website elsewhere, e.g. a static site generator such as Github Pages / Jekyll, or another SSG; or just for use generally in previewing markdown and pushing it to styled web content / "builds" to html and css)

Some next steps

- [ ] Really have to pick one webpage for my assignment, using one site builder!
- [ ] Work especially on chosen CTA option and implementation (for marketing content -- vs. "substantive" content)
