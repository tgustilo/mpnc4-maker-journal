# Day 1

This week's project is to work on landing pages.

Steps completed today

âœ… added folders and drafts here on my build journal (put drafts in \_drafts folder; folders will require an extra url step: my-site/posts/post1.html)

âœ… added projects and notes folders, as well as posts; and added a couple files (see index)

âœ… learned some more about how to use Github interface for editing (tricky! -- to create a folder, do it when you name it using "/"; to move a file back up out of a folder, use "../")

âœ… learned that if you create a release/tag (snapshot), you have to go back to main or you can't edit

Next steps

- ? fix the formatting on tasks (displays fine in Github preview, but browser adds bullet in front of checkbox. For now, will just use an emoji or bullet instead)
- choose which landing page you'll work on (see [Ideas](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/projects/landing-page-ideas.html))
- update [cohort projects](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/projects/cohort-projects.html)
- do it! [landing page creation notes](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/notes/landing-pages.html)
- write up my research & thoughts on CTAs (will be [cta notes](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/notes/ctas.html))
- review jekyll documentation, esp pages and [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
- try "." while in my github repo to get to an online web version of VS Code web for easier editing OR ðŸ¥´ create a local repo so I can edit files more conveniently off-line
