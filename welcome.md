# Welcome to my Build Journal

This journal (set of notes) is to document my build projects for Makerpad No Code Fundamentals Cohort 4. I'm still deciding exactly what projects I'll work on, but they will revolve around content, and using Github to manipulate that content (as "CMS"). I want to see what all can be done to leverage content dropped here.

Completed steps:
- [x] Set up my Github Pages with Philip's rad simple template - woo!
- [x] Created my first page
- [x] Up and publishes (don't forget to go to .html not .md version of the page)

Some next steps:
- [ ] Need dated entry scheme (and commit to posting frequency)
- [x] Need a landing / index page
- [ ] Find / tweak a couple theme elements (css) (eventually see if I can build a custom theme via Webflow / export)
- [ ] Create project pages to summarize milestones?
- [x] need to fix page header on notes to be blog title -> site title is in the config.yaml

Welcome!
