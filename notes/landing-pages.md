# Thinking through Landing Pages

## A first question 

**Which projects need landing pages**? I don't need just one single page for my business. I will probably need to create several pages for major product launches or new initiatives, or even ideas or teasers (to see if they get any traction). So this is a good skill to have. 

- [x] make a list of projects or initiatives that could use landing pages (done: see [Ideas](https://tgustilo.github.io/mpnc4-maker-journal/projects/landing-page-ideas.html))
- [] add some key info to share for each (for help, see resources for making *good* landing pages, e.g. [Shapiro](https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/landing-pages#theory))

## Gather resources

Next, for your chosen landing page project, you need gather **basic resources**: colors, font(s), and image assets.

- [] decide on and gather up branding and image assets; use color palette helpers, unsplash, illustrations or icons, brand assets (etc)

## What design?

You'll need **ideas for design**. Check dribble, [land-book site](https://land-book.com/), and/or template options of the website builder. (Or prepare to DIY.)

- [] get an idea for the overall design of your landing page

## Choose builder

Choose your **website builder** and template if you are using one. So far, I have worked with Carrd, Dorik, and Webflow. These are all fine options (at increasing levels of features/power and complexity).

- [] choose website builder & template, if desired (Carrd, Dorik, Webflow -- or other?)

## Special components needed? 

If your template doesn't have any needed special components (e.g. a pricing table), consider getting them from [elfsight.com](https://elfsight.com/) or some other resource. (Note: re: CTA, forms, etc, see below.)

- [] plan for any special embeds you might need

## CTA decisions

At this point, you can create a static page. IF you want/need a CTA (some kind of interaction from visitors), there are a variety of options. Basically, *think about* where you want people to enter a buyer's journey:

- [] decide if you want people to:

- a) follow you on social; 
- b) sign up for your email list (for example with Mailchimp or ConvertKit); 
- c) sign up for your newsletter; 
- d) contact you (via a form); 
- e) become a (free) member (i.e. do a genuine sign-up) right away.

These are the main options for a CTA.

Note that you may need to provide a lead magnet to swap for an email address. (It will take more than a simple landing page to offer one.)
Without attaching some kind of payment system, any member sign-up will need to be free.
The "power up" for this week's assignment is to include membership or community, which applies especially to option e.

Once you *decide* what kind of CTA you're going for, then it will be possible to figure out what tool options there are to accomplish it. See [Notes on CTAs](https://github.com/tgustilo/mpnc4-maker-journal/notes/ctas.html)
