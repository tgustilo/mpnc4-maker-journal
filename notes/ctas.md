# Thinking through CTAs

There are five basic options for a landing page's CTA (Call to Action). You want your site visitors to *do* something, to respond in some way to what you're presenting. You want them to enter your "buyer's journey." 

(CTAs are forms or buttons that can go anywhere on your website, not just the landing page. But presumably the landing page's primary marketing purpose is to deliver a CTA and get visitors to engage.)

The following options go from light responses to more intensive and committed responses from a site visitor to the CTA on your landing page.

## Option 1. You want visitors to follow you on social media

In this case, your landing page strategy is simple. Get some nice social media icons and link them to your social accounts. Put them prominently on your page and perhaps include/embed a sample post or tweet.

Asking for followers on social media assumes you *have social accounts set up* which are active and updated regularly. (Thus, to use this strategy you also need a social media marketing strategy and to understand how SM content will help your future customers, clients, and supporters.)

## Option 2. You want visitors to sign up for your email list

Almost all contemporary business wisdom emphasizes that you need to start right away to *grow your email list* (and/or "followers" -- see social media above). In this case, a landing page has as its primary CTA a way to capture email addresses.

The traditional way to do this is to use an email service provider (ESP) like MailChimp or ConvertKit or one of a g'zillion others. Here you have a few options to implement:

1. drop in a capture form provided by your ESP service (right onto your web page)
2. design a special form using your website builder, and then use Zapier or an integration to move that data into your ESP (or elsewhere); or, in the case of some of the more full-featured website platforms, you may be able to do simple emailing right from within the platform itself (see, for example, the many course platforms)
3. use a 3rd party form service (e.g. Typeform, Tally, Formspree), embed their form on your website, and then use an integration or Zapier to move that data into your ESP (or elsewhere)

Note that you may want to provide a **lead magnet** to entice visitors to give you their email. Basically you swap some bit of valuable content for an email address. (It will likely take more than a simple landing page to offer a lead magnet, and there are many options, so I won't elaborate here. Google "lead magnet" to find out more.)

Email lists are the traditional means of online marketing. You also have the option, instead of an ESP, to use an "all-in-one" CRM (customer relationship management). These are fuller database systems that include email capability (the "all-in-one" part), but focus primarily on tracking additional details of each individual contact through a longer sales process. Use a CRM (along with, or instead of an ESP) if your buyer's journey is more complicated or requires direct and personal interaction from you or your sales team. (Note that ESP *automations* try to provide an intermediate way to move potential customers along, through a series of auto-sent emails, without you having to interact with each potential customer individually.)

Outseta and Airtable are two friendly no-code options to manage a simple CRM. Like an ESP, Outseta provides a drop-in capture form (they also provide direct membership sign-up -- see below). Or, you can Zap data from your website capture into Outseta or another CRM. Airtable will require a Zap to move data over. You can then configure Airtable however you like, as a light CRM, to work with your customer (potential customer) data.

## Option 3. You want visitors to sign up for your newsletter

What do you do when you have a list of emails? You send emails. These could be marketing emails (of various sorts), or you could subscribe people to your newsletter.

Note: podcasts, YouTube channels, and other regular content that may be subscribed to works like a cross between social media following and newsletter. Follow the best practices of your chosen platform.

In this case, you could still use an ESP (most ESPs now offer simple newsletter services, along with bulk email blasts and automations), OR you could go direct and use a newsletter service such as Substack, Ghost, or Revue (Revue is now owned by TWitter and offers a potentially interesting combo strategy of social media, email capture, and newsletter). 

Whatever newsletter service you choose will provide an embeddable sign-up form to drop on your website as usual, or you may use a service like this to power your website in the first place, e.g. Ghost. (Or, you can use your web builder's form and use an integration or Zap to send the data over to your newsletter service.)

Do consider that just like when you ask visitors to follow you on social media, or when you ask them to join your email list (perhaps in exchange for a lead magnet), the same applies if visitors sign up for a newsletter: the implication is that **you will then need to supply a regular flow of content** (social media posts, emails, a regular newsletter) to your followers / subscribers. 

Unless your main product or service is *already* to provide content (perhaps your newsletter *is* your business), this means you will have a lot of content to continually generate for marketing purposes. (This has to be factored in along with whatever content you need to create as your main product or service. Undoubtedly there is overlap, but you'll need a content management strategy.)

## Option 4. You want visitors to contact you / fill out a form

A somewhat different option, if you don't expect mass interest, would be to ask visitors to use a contact form. This could be an application for membership, or to "tell us what you're interested in," or to request a quote or talk about customized services you could provide.

In this case, your landing page CTA strategy will be to use either your web builder's form module, or a 3rd party form service, to capture your visitor's information. Note that this will be a more complex form than just a name and email address. You'll need to think through what kinds of information you really need to know, without over-burdening them. 

Usually contact forms (either on a website platform, or third party) will email you directly with the entered information, so you can respond accordingly. Or, you could work with the data as captured within your website platform OR use an integration or Zap to transfer the data to your CRM or elsewhere.

## Option 5. You want visitors to become a (free) member, i.e. do a genuine sign-up on your site, right away

Finally, if you want to allow visitors to sign up for an account or membership on your website right away (for free, unless you intend to integrate a payment system), again, you can either use your platform's built-in membership module (e.g. Ghost) or use a 3rd party membership plug-in / service such as Outseta, Memberspace, or Memberstack. 

Note that these services allow you also to put some content on your website (beyond the landing page) behind a gate or (pay)wall, so that members have to log in to be able to see it. It can still be free, but it's not available to the public. Obviously paid memberships could provide additional *paywalled* content.

The "power up" for this week's assignment is to include membership or community, which applies especially to this last CTA option.

## Option 6. You want visitors to interact with you via chat

Intercom and other chat services can be embedded (and are becoming ubiquitous) on your landing page. (I'm not sure of the technical requirements to use these types of services.) If you're always available / live, or have customer support, there can be immediate interaction with a site visitor to answer questions. 

Otherwise, a bot can capture contact info and the visitor's question, and/or provide some basic (predictable, scripted) info. Using a bot allows you to get back to the person later. Be sure to post your typical response time (and respond asap!).

## Option 7. You want your visitors to register for an event, e.g. a webinar

Create a "poster" for an event on your landing page, and include a registration button for an upcoming Zoom gathering. Live events, too, are becoming an ubiquitous method for people to engage with your brand, membership, or content offerings.

## Option 8. You want your visitors to grab a spot on your calendar for an in-person chat

Be careful with this option, but you could use Calendly to give visitors a link to sign up for a time on your calendar. It might be an alternative to using a contact form, or perhaps (better) a *second step* in getting to know a potential client, investor, or other visitor you want to engage one-on-one.

Re: WordPress. I have not given options for how to do any of this in WordPress. This website builder platform can do it *all*, usually with plugins of various sorts. Other standard commercial website builder platforms such as Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly also provide total solutions for most of these functions. But note that they all go well beyond the features needed for building simple landing pages.
