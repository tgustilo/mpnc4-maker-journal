# Makerpad Cohort Projects

Assignments for the course include the following, each with its own optional "power up". I will fill in the details of which projects I'll do for each assignment as I go. When each project reaches a shareable stage, I'll add a link. (Note: I'm writing in November 2021. If you happen to be looking at this some time in the far future, project links will likely no longer be active.)
