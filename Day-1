# Day 1

This week's task is to work with landing pages.

A first question: what projects do I need to make landing pages for? IOW I don't need just one single page for my business. I will probably need to create several pages for major product launches or new initiatives, or even ideas or teasers (to see if they get any traction).
So, 

- [] make a list of projects or initiatives that could use landing pages
- [] add some key info to share on the page (see resources for making *good* landing pages, e.g. Shapiro

Next, for any given landing page you need basic resources: colors, font(s), and image assets.

- [] collect branding and image assets

You will need some ideas for design. Check Land-book and/or template options in the website builder of choice. Or prepare to DIY.

- [] get an idea for the overall design of your landing page

Choose your website builder (and template if you are using one). So far, I have worked with Carrd, Dorik, and Webflow. These are all fine options, so choose one of them for this project:
